# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on what is best for the company
- Showing empathy towards your coworkers
- Focusing on encouragement and mentorship towards all members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Responsibilities

Lead developers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Lead developers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. This will help ensure that this
repository continues to be an emotionally open place for positive contributions
to the organization.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting:

- The lead developer responsible for the project at hand.
- Fabio Marzullo (@fabiomarzullo on Slack) or any lead developer.

All complaints will be reviewed, investigated and given a response.
If an issue does arise in which any of the actions
outlined above have to be taken, you and @fabiomarzullo will be notified by email
along with an explanation of why the action was taken. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Breaches of this code of conduct may result in disciplinary action outlined in
the BeyondRisk employee policies.
